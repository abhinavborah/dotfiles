# Dotfiles for the tools I use daily

These files control the behavior of my applications from boot to termination and everything in between.
This repository aims at providing an easy remote access to all my tailored config files.

## Prerequisite

> For package management on macOS I prefer [Homebrew](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew). Not a necessity, just my preference.
>
> ```
> brew install --cask alacritty karabiner-elements tmux
> ```

Application specific prerequisites:

### alacritty

Download the [Meslo Nerd Font](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/tree/master/patched-fonts/Meslo) for extra icons and symbols.

### tmux

```
git clone https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm ~/.config/tmux/plugins/tpm
```

## Stuck somewhere?

> RTFM (Read The Friendly Manual) :)

For each application I have provided their respective markdown files in the [docs](./docs/)
